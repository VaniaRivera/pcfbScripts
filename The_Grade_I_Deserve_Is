'The Grade I Deserve Is...'

I think I deserve an 8. I am not used to the Dutch 
In Mexico a 10 is something that could be achieved
For me is very weird that a 10 in the Dutch system is nearly impossible to achieve

All the screenshots of what I did are in the word document github_Vania.docx
I try all the options I could

I create a repository called pcfbScripts that I shared with you
I put a picture in my profile
I did the to do list at the Issues
I have the license and the .gitignore file
I have some closed issues
I made several commitments with the right username and e-mail address
I delete a file for a shared repository and then I went one commitment back to recover the file.
I have a rejected pull request
I am following 3 different persons
And I star a repository
